Sitecore-Publish-Exclusions
=======================

This Sitecore module allows you to configure publish exclusions (not publish restrictions) for any content item and its descendants in your Sitecore instance. Publish exclusions can be configured separately for each publishing target and for each publish mode.

More details about this module is available on my blog [post](https://thesitecorezone.wordpress.com/2015/10/31/sitecore-publish-exclusions/). It will soon be available on Sitecore Marketplace module also.
